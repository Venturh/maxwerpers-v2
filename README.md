  My personal portfolio 2.0
</h1>

This is the second version of my personal portfolio. It replaced the first one, made with Create React App and Material Ui.
For this project i used Gatsby to benefit from the static page benefits, since i really didnÂ´t need any dynamic content on my portfolio. When I have to update the portfolio i can just rebuild it with Netlify build hooks.
If you want to check out my portfolio yourself you can go to https://gportfolio.netlify.app/.
